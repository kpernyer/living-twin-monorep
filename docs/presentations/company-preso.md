## The Problem

In today's fast-paced world, organizations struggle with:

- **Misalignment:** Disconnect between high-level strategy and day-to-day execution.
- **Information Overload:** Employees are bombarded with data, making it hard to focus on what matters.
- **Slow Decision-Making:** Critical decisions are delayed due to lack of clarity and consensus.

- **Align Priorities:** Cascade goals from the CEO to every team member.
