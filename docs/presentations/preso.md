# Living Twin

## The Future of Organizational Alignment

---

## The Problem

In today's fast-paced world, organizations struggle with:

- **Misalignment:** Disconnect between high-level strategy and day-to-day execution.
- **Information Overload:** Employees are bombarded with mixed messages, making it hard to focus on what matters.
- **Slow Decision-Making:** Critical decisions are delayed due to lack of clarity and consensus.

## Running on All Cylinders – Every Day

“It’s old but runs well… on six cylinders.”

That’s what my neighbor in Cupertino told me about his 1966 Pontiac station wagon — a beautiful V8 that had lost part of its potential.

Many companies are just like that Pontiac: strong heritage, big potential, but not firing on all cylinders. Strategic priorities exist on paper, but in the real world, they lose momentum. 

Day-to-day firefighting overtakes long-term goals.
And the worst part? You only find out a year later.

## Chip-Trimming Your Organisation

Modern engines can be tuned in real time through software. At Aprio, we bring the same principle to your organisation.

We’ve built a continuous “chip-trim” system for management — a way to adjust course dynamically, not quarterly or annually, but daily.

## The Organisational Twin

At the heart is your Organisational Twin — a living, learning digital counterpart of your company.

- **Misalignment:** Your strategic direction (your “destination”)
- **Misalignment:** Your current state (your "position")
- **Misalignment:** The gap between them (your “delta”)

You interact with it through short, natural conversations — speech by default, typing when convenient. Five minutes, several times a week, is all it takes.

## Why This Works

Our system applies the Japanese Hoshin Kanri method

 • Policy Deployment: Long-term strategy cascades clearly through the entire organisation.
 • Catchball: Goals and plans “thrown” back and forth between levels, refined and understood before action.
 • Alignment: Everyone knows how their daily work ties directly to strategic priorities.

The Twin acts as the ultimate Catchball partner:
 • Mediates between top management and teams.
 • Explains the “why” so priorities are correctly interpreted.
 • Flags uncertainty back to leadership before misalignment turns into a lost year.
 • Integrates live data from internal systems, market signals, and AI agents.

## From Static Plans to Living Strategy

Old way: Create a strategic plan in January. Hope it survives 12 months. Discover misalignment next December.
Aprio way:
 • Your Twin constantly checks pulse and priorities.
 • It broadcasts in the right tone and context to each audience.
 • It feeds management with continuous insight.
 • It helps everyone fire on all cylinders, all year.

## The Payoff for the CEO & Board  

 • No more strategic drift — Long-term goals stay visible and actionable.
 • Faster course corrections — Spot and fix misalignment instantly.
 • Higher execution velocity — Everyone pulls in the same direction.
 • Better ROI on leadership time — Five-minute conversations replace endless status meetings.
