# Aprio — 5‑Slide CEO Pitch

## Slide 1 — Title
**Aprio: Run Your Organisation on All Cylinders**  
Continuous strategic alignment through conversation  
*Speaker note:* Open with the 1966 Pontiac V8 story — “runs well on six cylinders.” Analogy: many companies operate below potential.

## Slide 2 — The Problem
**Strategic Drift is Silent but Costly**  
- Strategic priorities lose momentum when firefighting takes over  
- Misalignment often discovered months or a year later  
- Lost innovation, missed targets, wasted leadership cycles  
*Note:* “We only found out in December.”

## Slide 3 — The Aprio Way
**Continuous Chip‑Trim for Organisations**  
- Organisational Twin that listens, learns, and mediates  
- Grounded in Hoshin Kanri and Catchball (explain the “why”)  
- Short conversations (5 minutes, several times a week)  
- Real‑time prioritisation and alignment

## Slide 4 — How It Works
(Use Catchball diagram)  
- Strategic “cylinders” defined at onboarding (destination vs current state)  
- Twin tracks execution, detects drift early, and explains “why”  
- Bounces unclear priorities back to leadership for “vibe coding”  
- Integrates data from systems, agents, and trend analysis

## Slide 5 — The Payoff
**From Static Plans to Living Strategy**  
- Alignment: everyone pulls in the same direction  
- Velocity: faster course corrections  
- Transparency: no year‑end surprises  
- Focus: fire on all cylinders all year

## Slide 6 — Call to Action (Optional)
**Pilot the Organisational Twin**  
- 90‑day trial with weekly impact reporting  
- KPIs: alignment score, execution velocity, drift detection time
