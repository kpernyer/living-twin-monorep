# GitHub Setup and Integration Guide

This guide walks you through setting up the Living Twin monorepo on GitHub with full CI/CD integration.

## ðŸš€ Initial GitHub Repository Setup

### 1. Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub** and create a new repository:
   - Repository name: `living-twin-monorepo`
   - Description: "Living Twin - RAG-enabled organizational twin system"
   - Visibility: Private (recommended) or Public
   - **Do NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

2. **Copy the repository URL** (you'll need this for the next step)

### 2. Connect Local Repository to GitHub

```bash
# Add GitHub as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/living-twin-monorepo.git

# Verify remote was added
git remote -v

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Verify Repository Structure

After pushing, verify on GitHub that you see:

- âœ… All apps/, packages/, docs/, tools/ directories
- âœ… GitHub Actions workflows in .github/workflows/
- âœ… No .env files (secrets protected)
- âœ… .env.example file present

## ðŸ”§ GitHub Actions Configuration

### Required Repository Secrets

Set up these secrets in **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions**:

#### **Basic Secrets**

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key-here
```

#### **GCP/Cloud Run Deployment Secrets**

```bash
GCP_PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id
WIF_PROVIDER=projects/123456789/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/github-pool/providers/github-provider
WIF_SERVICE_ACCOUNT=github-actions@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
CLOUD_RUN_SERVICE_ACCOUNT=cloud-run-sa@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

#### **Optional Notification Secrets**

```bash
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/SLACK/WEBHOOK
```

### GitHub Actions Workflows Overview

The repository includes 4 pre-configured workflows:

#### 1. **CI Workflow** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

- **Triggers:** Push/PR to main/develop branches
- **Tests:** All apps (API, admin web, mobile)
- **Validates:** Terraform, Docker builds, security scanning
- **Runs on:** Every push and pull request

#### 2. **Cloud Run Deployment** (`.github/workflows/deploy-cloud-run.yml`)

- **Triggers:** Push to main/staging branches
- **Deploys:** API to Google Cloud Run
- **Includes:** Health checks, performance testing, security scanning
- **Environments:** Production (main) and Staging (staging)

#### 3. **Production Deployment** (`.github/workflows/deploy-prod.yml`)

- **Triggers:** Manual dispatch or tags
- **Deploys:** Full production environment
- **Includes:** Database migrations, infrastructure updates

#### 4. **Staging Deployment** (`.github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml`)

- **Triggers:** Push to develop branch
- **Deploys:** Staging environment for testing
- **Includes:** Integration tests, performance benchmarks

## ðŸ”’ Security Setup

### 1. Branch Protection Rules

Set up branch protection in **Settings > Branches**:

**For `main` branch:**

```markdown
âœ… Require a pull request before merging
âœ… Require approvals (1 minimum)
âœ… Dismiss stale PR approvals when new commits are pushed
âœ… Require review from code owners
âœ… Require status checks to pass before merging
   - Select: CI / admin-web
   - Select: CI / api  
   - Select: CI / mobile
   - Select: CI / terraform
âœ… Require branches to be up to date before merging
âœ… Require conversation resolution before merging
âœ… Restrict pushes that create files larger than 100MB
```

**For `develop` branch:**

```markdown
âœ… Require a pull request before merging
âœ… Require status checks to pass before merging
âœ… Require branches to be up to date before merging
```

### 2. Security Alerts

Enable in **Settings > Security & analysis**:

```markdown
âœ… Dependency graph
âœ… Dependabot alerts
âœ… Dependabot security updates
âœ… Secret scanning
âœ… Push protection for secret scanning
```

### 3. Code Scanning

The CI workflow includes Trivy security scanning. Results appear in the **Security** tab.

## ðŸ‘¥ Team Collaboration Setup

### 1. Create Teams (if organization)

In your GitHub organization:

- **@living-twin/core** - Core developers (admin access)
- **@living-twin/developers** - All developers (write access)
- **@living-twin/reviewers** - Code reviewers (triage access)

### 2. CODEOWNERS File

Create `.github/CODEOWNERS`:

```bash
# Global owners
* @living-twin/core

# API and backend
/apps/api/ @living-twin/backend-team
/packages/gcp_firebase/ @living-twin/devops-team

# Frontend applications  
/apps/admin_web/ @living-twin/frontend-team
/apps/mobile/ @living-twin/mobile-team

# Infrastructure
/docker/ @living-twin/devops-team
/.github/workflows/ @living-twin/devops-team

# Documentation
/docs/ @living-twin/core
```

### 3. Issue Templates

Create `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`:

**Bug Report** (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md`):

```markdown
---
name: Bug report
about: Create a report to help us improve
title: '[BUG] '
labels: bug

## ðŸš€ Deployment Environments

### Environment Strategy

- **`main`** â†’ Production environment
- **`staging`** â†’ Staging environment  
- **`develop`** â†’ Development environment
- **Feature branches** â†’ CI testing only

### Environment Variables by Branch

**Production (main branch):**

```bash
ENVIRONMENT=production
DEBUG=false
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

**Staging (staging branch):**

```bash
ENVIRONMENT=staging
DEBUG=true
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
```

**Development (develop branch):**

```bash
ENVIRONMENT=development
DEBUG=true
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
```

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring and Observability

### 1. GitHub Insights

Monitor repository health in **Insights**:

- **Pulse** - Recent activity overview
- **Contributors** - Team contribution metrics
- **Traffic** - Repository views and clones
- **Dependency graph** - Package dependencies

### 2. Actions Monitoring

Track CI/CD performance:

- **Actions** tab shows all workflow runs
- Set up notifications for failed deployments
- Monitor build times and success rates

### 3. Security Monitoring

Regular security checks:

- **Security** tab for vulnerability alerts
- **Dependabot** for dependency updates
- **Code scanning** results from Trivy

## ðŸ”„ Development Workflow

### 1. Feature Development

```bash
# Create feature branch from develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"

# Push and create PR
git push -u origin feature/new-feature
```

### 2. Pull Request Process

1. **Create PR** targeting `develop` branch
2. **Fill PR template** with description and testing notes
3. **Wait for CI** to pass (all checks green)
4. **Request review** from appropriate team members
5. **Address feedback** and update PR
6. **Merge** once approved and CI passes

### 3. Release Process

```bash
# Create release branch from develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b release/v1.2.0

# Update version numbers and changelog
# Commit changes
git commit -m "chore: prepare release v1.2.0"

# Create PR to main
# After merge, tag the release
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "Release v1.2.0"
git push origin v1.2.0
```

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### **1. CI Fails with "No such file or directory"**

- Check that paths in workflows match monorepo structure
- Verify working-directory settings in workflow files

#### **2. Secrets Not Available in Workflows**

- Ensure secrets are set in repository settings
- Check secret names match exactly in workflow files

#### **3. Branch Protection Prevents Merge**

- Ensure all required status checks pass
- Get required approvals from code owners

#### **4. Docker Build Fails**

- Check Dockerfile paths are correct for monorepo
- Verify build context includes necessary files

### Getting Help

1. **Check workflow logs** in Actions tab
2. **Review security alerts** in Security tab
3. **Check branch protection** settings
4. **Verify secrets** are properly configured
