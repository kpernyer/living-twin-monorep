## 🎯 **Key Innovations**

### **1. SWOT + Porter's-Based Keyword Generation**

```python
# Before: Static keywords
keywords = ["competitor", "industry", "market trends"]

# After: Dynamic SWOT + Porter's-based keywords
strategic_keywords = generate_agent_keywords_from_swot_and_porters(swot_analysis, porters_analysis, capabilities)
# Result: ["AI security", "market share", "emerging markets", "Apple Pay", 
#          "bargaining power", "new entrants", "substitute products", "supplier consolidation",
#          "regulation", "partnership", "fintech", "digital payments", ...]
```

### **2. Strategic Signal Detection**

```python
# Before: Simple relevance scoring
relevance_score = len(keywords_matched) / len(config.keywords)

# After: Multi-dimensional strategic scoring
strategic_impact_score = (
    relevance_score * 0.4 +
    urgency_score * 0.3 +
    confidence_score * 0.3
)
```

### **3. SWOT + Porter's-Categorized Signals**

```python
# Before: Generic agent results
agent_result = AgentResult(
    title="Apple Pay Expands",
    content="...",
    sentiment="neutral"
)

# After: Strategic signals with SWOT + Porter's context
strategic_signal = StrategicSignal(
    title="Apple Pay Expands to 15 New Countries",
    swot_categories=[SWOTCategory.THREAT],
    porters_forces=[PortersForce.COMPETITIVE_RIVALRY, PortersForce.NEW_ENTRANTS],
    affected_elements=["threat-1"],  # Big Tech Competition
    affected_forces=["rivalry-1", "entrants-1"],  # Competitive dynamics
    impact_direction=SignalImpact.NEGATIVE,
    priority=SignalPriority.HIGH,
    strategic_impact_score=0.85
)
```

### **4. Actionable Strategic Analysis with Competitive Intelligence**

```python
# Before: Raw content
content = "Apple Pay expands to new markets..."

# After: Strategic implications and actions with Porter's analysis
signal_analysis = SignalAnalysis(
    strategic_implications=[
        "Increases threat level in Big Tech Competition",
        "May impact our market expansion strategy",
        "Strengthens competitive rivalry in mobile payments",
        "Creates barriers for new entrants"
    ],
    recommended_actions=[
        "Analyze Apple Pay expansion impact on target markets",
        "Develop competitive positioning strategy",
        "Consider partnership opportunities",
        "Assess impact on customer bargaining power",
        "Review supplier relationships for competitive advantage"
    ],
    competitive_intelligence={
        "market_position": "challenger",
        "competitive_dynamics": "intensifying",
        "customer_power": "increasing",
