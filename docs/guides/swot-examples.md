## üîç **Step 2: Agent Configuration with SWOT Keywords**

### **Generated Keywords from SWOT Analysis**

```python
# Example generated keywords (top 20)
swot_keywords = [
    # High priority (from Priority 1 elements)
    "AI security", "fraud detection", "market share", "emerging markets",
    "Apple Pay", "Google Pay", "big tech",
    
    # Medium priority (from Priority 2 elements)
    "user experience", "UX", "brand awareness", "partnership",
    "regulation", "policy change",
    
    # Industry-specific
    "fintech", "digital payments", "mobile payments", "payment security",
    
    # Expanded terms
    "competitive advantage", "market leader", "innovation", "disruption",
    "compliance", "governance", "cybersecurity"
]
```

### **Enhanced Agent Configuration**

```python
# Before SWOT integration
base_config = AgentConfig(
    keywords=["fintech", "payments", "AI"],
    update_frequency_minutes=30,
    max_results_per_update=10
)

# After SWOT integration
enhanced_config = AgentConfig(
    keywords=swot_keywords,  # 50+ strategic keywords
    update_frequency_minutes=30,
    max_results_per_update=10,
    filters={
        "swot_analysis_id": "swot-123",
