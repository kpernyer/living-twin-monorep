# Example generated keywords (top 20)
swot_keywords = [
    # High priority (from Priority 1 elements)
    "AI security", "fraud detection", "market share", "emerging markets",
    "Apple Pay", "Google Pay", "big tech",
    
    # Medium priority (from Priority 2 elements)
    "user experience", "UX", "brand awareness", "partnership",
    "regulation", "policy change",
    
    # Industry-specific

# Before SWOT integration
base_config = AgentConfig(
    keywords=["fintech", "payments", "AI"],
    update_frequency_minutes=30,
    max_results_per_update=10
)
