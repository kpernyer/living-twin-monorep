- Complete any remaining development milestones

**Phase 2: Experimental Cursor Integration (Optional)**
If you want to explore Cursor benefits:

1. **Install Cursor alongside VS Code** (don't replace immediately)
2. **Use Cursor for specific tasks**:
   - New feature development (leverage real-time suggestions)
   - Code refactoring (use advanced refactoring tools)
   - Bug fixing (benefit from real-time analysis)
3. **Keep Cline in VS Code for**:
   - System-level operations (Docker, deployment)
   - Multi-file refactoring
   - Documentation generation
   - Testing and CI/CD operations

**Phase 3: Evaluate and Decide**
After 2-4 weeks of parallel usage:

- Assess development velocity improvements
- Evaluate code quality benefits
- Consider cost vs. benefit
- Make informed decision about long-term setup

### **Specific Use Cases for Each Tool**
