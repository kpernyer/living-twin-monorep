## Mobile Experience with Flutter (1/2)

The mobile application is built using Flutter to provide a high-performance, native-like experience.

- **True Native Performance**: Flutter compiles to native code, resulting in faster startup times and smoother animations.
- **Consistent UI**: Flutter's rendering engine ensures a consistent look and feel across all platforms.
- **Hardware Acceleration**: Direct access to the device's GPU for smooth animations and complex UI transitions.

---

## Mobile Experience with Flutter (2/2)

- **Deep OS Integration**: Seamless integration with native APIs for features like sensors and cameras.
- **Local Hardware Access**: Direct access to microphone and speech processing hardware for on-device voice commands, ensuring privacy and low latency.

---

## Conversational AI (1/2)

The user experience is centered around a sophisticated conversational AI that evolves from a simple RAG system to a stateful conversational agent.

- **Stateless RAG**: The initial implementation provides a simple question-answering system based on retrieving information from documents.
- **Conversational Memory**: The system is enhanced with conversational memory, allowing it to understand context and maintain a conversation.

## Conversational AI (2/2)

- **Contextual Queries**: The AI can understand follow-up questions and refer to previous exchanges.
- **Personalized Responses**: The AI can provide personalized responses based on the user's role and context.
- **On-device Prompt Improvement**: Flutter applications can refine prompts locally before sending them to the backend, improving response quality and reducing latency.

## Voice Integration

A real-time voice interface provides a natural and intuitive way to interact with the system.

- **Real-time Voice**: A streaming audio processing pipeline with immediate response for a natural conversation flow.
- **Hybrid Architecture**: A combination of on-device speech recognition for real-time feedback and server-side processing for accuracy.
- **Advanced Voice Features**: The roadmap includes features like interrupt handling, emotion detection, and multi-language support.

## Admin Web Interface

A React-based web interface provides a comprehensive set of tools for administrative tasks.

- **User Management**: Invite users, manage roles, and set permissions.
- **Content Management**: Upload, organize, and manage documents.
- **System Monitoring**: Monitor the health and performance of the system.
- **Configuration**: Configure system settings and integrations.
