## Strategic Alignment  

Continuous strategic alignment through conversation 

*The 1966 Pontiac V8 story — “runs well on six cylinders.”*

Analogy: many companies operate below their potential

---

## The Problem  

**Strategic Drift is Silent but Costly**  

* Strategic priorities lose momentum when firefighting takes over  
* Misalignment often discovered months or a year later  
* Lost innovation, missed targets, wasted leadership cycles  

***“We only found out in December.”***

---

## The Aprio One Way  

**Continuous Chip‑Trim for Organisations**  

* Organisational Twin that listens, learns, contributes and mediates  
* Hoshin Kanri Management theory  
* Short conversations (5 minutes, several times a week)  
* Real‑time prioritisation and alignment

***“Vibe code your organisation in real-time”***

---

## How It Works  

* Strategic “cylinders” defined at onboarding (destination vs current state)  
* Twin tracks execution, detects drift early, and explains “why”  
* Bounces unclear priorities back to leadership for further “vibe coding”  
* Injects information from systems, AI-agents, and external trend analysis

***“Leadership nudge the organistion until direct orders are needed”***

---

## The Payoff  

**From Static Plans to Living Strategy**  

* ___Alignment___: everyone pulls in the same direction  
* ___Velocity___: faster course corrections  
* ___Transparency___: no year‑end surprises  
* ___Focus___: fire on all cylinders all year

***“An organisation that run without hick-ups”***

---

## Call to Action

**Pilot the Organisational Twin**  

* 90‑day trial with weekly impact reporting
